    {{!-- The todos partial below is handlebars syntax, and is targeted in the 'todoController' file,
    in the app.get function. The code that targets it is this: '{todos: data}',
    which works by putting the target in curly braces. The first parts 'todos' targets the partial,
    the second part 'data' tells it what to pass to the partial, in this case 'data' which is the array --}}
